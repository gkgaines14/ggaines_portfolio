                I'm Greg Gaines and I love this work.
                <br />
                <br />
                I love the idea that something as straight-forward as a website
                can become the digital representation of an organization’s
                entire theory of action. I find the work of transforming my
                clients’ mission, purpose and passion into an interactive
                digital experience to be the most rewarding way to apply my
                skills and years of experience.
                <br />
                <br />
                Apart from my work in the realm of web development, I’ve spent
                many years designing strategic data solutions and building
                custom tools in a variety of programming languages, across
                dozens of deployment environments. I have a passion for
                strategic problem solving and I love to apply my expertise to
                building applications and tools that allow my clients to
                automate processes and optimize their workflow.
                <br />
                <br />

                Throughout my career, I have found that being able to make
                compelling business narratives, develop actionable strategic
                plans and execute on core business functions with fidelity
                requires excellent systems and a mastery of how to align that
                infrastructure to your daily business routines. Further, the
                best systems, with the most effective infrastructure, are almost
                always predicated on having highly efficient tools and accurate
                data available at all levels of the organization. It’s my hope
                that I can partner with you in order to bring those types of
                resources to bear within your organization and help you achieve
                your goals quickly and efficiently.

          I’ve spent most of my career working as an operations, technology and
          finance executive in Washington DC, in the public education sector. I
          have experience in every aspect of organizational operations
          management and I’ve worked in government, public non-profit and the

                  I earned a Masters Degree in Public Policy from The George
                  Washington University while working as a Data Analyst for the
                  Arlington Public School system in Northern Virginia. While
                  there, I served as the tech lead for the finance division
                  during our ERP implementation. This would serve as my
                  introduction to data systems integration and was my first
                  database administrator role.

                  I joined DCPS to help launch the District-wide Data and
                  Accountability division. We were tasked with creating a brand
                  new accountability framework for data collection, data
                  storage/integrity, and state-wide reporting. I was the lead
                  for our data governance policy and I designed an in-house
                  application that linked student records, district-level
                  operations data, staffing and org-wide goals. The application
                  allowed us to track organizational mandates and generate
                  progress reports for strategic goals.

                  For 5 years I served as the Director of Budget Operations at

                  management and to build a custom system for budget
                  forecasting, approvals and reporting. I leveraged HTML,
                  Javascript, SQL and MS SharePoint to create a budget
                  management tool that supported everything from quarterly Board
                  of Trustees reviews to weekly school-level meetings between
                  principals and their business managers.

                  with a custom front-end for user access. This was a great
                  transitional project for my journey into web development.
